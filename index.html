       <p class='short'>This here is Andrew. We rescued him as he was dehdrated and left out in the hot sun.
       He is an American Shorthair, and we are proud to say he is with a loving family that takes care of him.</p>

        <p class='he'><h3>Burmese Cat - Jack</h3></p>
        <p class='um'>This is Jack, he once was scard and didn't trust anyone. We believed he was abused, for we found
        him locked in a cage by a busy highway. He was severaly unnourished and could barley move. He is now healthy
        and more friendly towards people. I believe one day he will be welcomed by a family with open arms.</p>

        <p class='he'><h3>Exotic Shorthair - Nibs</h3></p>
        <p class='tic'>Another little cutie we have is Nibs here. She was found in a bag, his fur was matted. She was in much worse condition
        then Andrew and Jack. We didn't beleive that she would make it, but she stood strong and now she is health. Although she seems not
        to be a little scarce at times.</p>
